Project Nexus Frontend Engineering Track

Program Overview

The ProDev Frontend Engineering Program is a practical, project-driven training focused on modern frontend development. It sharpens your skills with real-world tools and workflows, helping you grow from “comfortable with the basics” to project-ready.

Core Focus Areas

This program assumes you already understand HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
The main learning outcomes build on that foundation:

Modern frontend frameworks and tooling

Next.js for full-stack React applications

TypeScript for safer, cleaner code

React Native for mobile development

Performance, scalability, and PWA concepts


Key Technologies Covered

Next.js

Tailwind CSS

React Native

TypeScript

SCSS/SASS

State management (Redux, Context API)

PWA fundamentals for fast, offline-capable apps

SEO-focused app structure and rendering strategies


Challenges & How I Solved Them

One of the biggest hurdles early on was not being able to write code confidently without looking at provided examples.
What helped was breaking things down:

Sharing code with AI tools to walk through it line by line

Rewriting small sections myself until the logic became natural

Gradually building from “copying to understand” → “writing from scratch”


That process made everything click.

Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

Documentation is your best friend — don’t avoid it.

Always research a concept before starting implementation.

Build small, test fast, and refine.

Stay consistent; progress compounds quickly in frontend dev.
